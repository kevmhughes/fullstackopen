# Full Stack Open 

The **Full Stack Open** course, offered by the University of Helsinki, provides a comprehensive introduction to modern web development. It focuses on building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) using ReactJS, along with backend development through Node.js and RESTful APIs. The course also dives into advanced topics such as GraphQL, testing, environment management, configuration, and database integration. On completing the course participants earn a certificate and University of Helsinki ECTS credits, making it a valuable addition to professional or academic credentials.

## Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps

In this part, the learner will become familiar with the practical aspects of taking the course. Following that, they will be provided with an overview of the fundamental concepts of web development. Additionally, there will be a discussion on the significant advances in web application development over the past few decades, highlighting key innovations and technological progress.

## Part 1: Introduction to React

In this part, the learner will familiarize themselves with the React library, which will be used to write the code that runs in the browser. They will also explore some important features of JavaScript that are essential for understanding React and working with it effectively.

## Part 2: Communicating with the Server

In this part, the learner will continue their introduction to React. First, they will explore how to render a data collection, such as a list of names, to the screen. Afterward, they will examine how a user can submit data to a React application through HTML forms. The focus will then shift to how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored on a remote backend server. Finally, the learner will take a brief look at a few simple methods for adding CSS styles to their React applications.

## Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

In this part, the focus shifts to the backend, specifically the implementation of functionality on the server side of the stack. The team will create a simple REST API using Node.js in conjunction with the Express library. Data for the application will be stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring smooth interaction between the server and the data layer. Once the backend is functional, the team will proceed to deploy the application to the internet, making it accessible for use.

## Part 4: Testing Express Servers, User Administration

In this part, the focus shifts to continuing work on the backend. The first major task will be writing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend components. Once testing is complete, attention will turn to implementing user authentication and authorization, securing access to the applicationâ€™s resources and ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

## Part 5: Testing React Apps

In this section, the focus shifts back to the frontend. The first step is to explore various options for testing React code, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application's user interface. Alongside testing, token-based authentication will be implemented, allowing users to securely log in and interact with the application. This authentication mechanism will involve generating and managing tokens that are used for verifying user identity and granting access to protected resources within the app.

## Part 6: Advanced State Management 

As applications grow larger, placing the application's state and state logic directly inside React components becomes less manageable. To address this, state management should be moved outside of React components. One popular solution for managing the state of React applications is the Redux library. In this context, the lightweight version of Redux that is directly supported by React is introduced. This version utilizes the React Context API and the useReducer hook. Additionally, the React Query library is explored, which simplifies the management of server state. By using these tools, developers can streamline their state management strategies, improving the scalability and maintainability of larger applications.

## Part 7: React Router, Custom Hooks, Styling Apps with CSS and Webpack

development. First, they'll dive into React Router, a powerful tool that allows them to split the application into multiple views that are conditionally rendered based on the URL in the browser's address bar. This section will give them the skills to manage navigation in React applications effectively. Next, the course will explore different ways to apply CSS styles within React apps, expanding on the styling techniques introduced earlier. Whether it's through traditional CSS, CSS-in-JS, or other approaches, students will gain flexibility in how they handle styles in React projects. While Vite has been used throughout the course to set up and build applications, learners will also be introduced to Webpack. This tool enables them to configure their entire build process from scratch. Students will learn how to customize Webpack to suit their specific needs, giving them a deeper understanding of the toolchain behind modern JavaScript apps. Finally, the course will cover hook functions, focusing on how to define and use custom hooks. Custom hooks allow for reusable logic, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of their React applications. By the end of this section, learners will have a comprehensive understanding of these essential tools and techniques, making them more proficient in building complex React applications.
