# Full Stack Open 

The **Full Stack Open** course, offered by the University of Helsinki, provides a comprehensive introduction to modern web development. It focuses on building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) using ReactJS, along with backend development through Node.js and RESTful APIs. The course also dives into advanced topics such as GraphQL, testing, environment management, configuration, and database integration. On completing the course participants earn a certificate and University of Helsinki ECTS credits, making it a valuable addition to professional or academic credentials.

## Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps

In this part, the learner will become familiar with the practical aspects of taking the course. Following that, they will be provided with an overview of the fundamental concepts of web development. Additionally, there will be a discussion on the significant advances in web application development over the past few decades, highlighting key innovations and technological progress.

## Part 1: Introduction to React

In this part, the learner will familiarize themselves with the React library, which will be used to write the code that runs in the browser. They will also explore some important features of JavaScript that are essential for understanding React and working with it effectively.

## Part 2: Communicating with the Server

In this part, the learner will continue their introduction to React. First, they will explore how to render a data collection, such as a list of names, to the screen. Afterward, they will examine how a user can submit data to a React application through HTML forms. The focus will then shift to how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored on a remote backend server. Finally, the learner will take a brief look at a few simple methods for adding CSS styles to their React applications.

## Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

In this part, the focus shifts to the backend, specifically the implementation of functionality on the server side of the stack. The team will create a simple REST API using Node.js in conjunction with the Express library. Data for the application will be stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring smooth interaction between the server and the data layer. Once the backend is functional, the team will proceed to deploy the application to the internet, making it accessible for use.

## Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration

In this part, the focus shifts to continuing work on the backend. The first major task will be writing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend components. Once testing is complete, attention will turn to implementing user authentication and authorization, securing access to the applicationâ€™s resources and ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
